<h2 align="left">Hey there 👋</h2>

###

This is Jackson! I currently work as a DevOps Engineer at Senai Alagoas. My technology stack includes Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana, Traefik, CephFS, Terraform, Ansible and more.

What I love about DevOps is building and automating scalable infrastructures while exploring new tools and technologies 🛠️.

During my spare time, I enjoy setting up labs to test Kubernetes, experimenting with automation, and constantly breaking and fixing things in my homelab.
